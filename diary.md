I find out thanks to [an article in the Guardian]http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/17/fracking-huge-impact-uk-shale-gas-industry-revealed) that the map of the UK areas being evaluated for shale gas extraction was made available in the context of a wider DECC report. I decide that that would be a great open data exercise.

I start developing a prototype based on 'reversing engineering' the information I see in the PDF files as apparently there is no machine-readable data I can use.

Thanks to an exchange with DECC [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/giacecco/status/415106011976839168) I find out that plenty of the data beyond the report is actually available at [https://www.gov.uk/oil-and-gas-onshore-maps-and-gis-shapefiles](https://www.gov.uk/oil-and-gas-onshore-maps-and-gis-shapefiles).

Moreover, the map for the areas that are already licensed can be browsed interactively on the UK Onshore Geophysical Library (UKOGL) website at [http://maps.lynxinfo.co.uk/UKOGL_LIVEV2/DeccLicences.html](http://maps.lynxinfo.co.uk/UKOGL_LIVEV2/DeccLicences.html), although, to tell you the truth, are not that readable (e.g. woudl you be able to find your house in the map below?).

All of this is great news in any case, as I now just need to check that the data is usable and accessible by the public without the need of data analysis or programming skills. If that was the case, there would still be some work for me to do.
